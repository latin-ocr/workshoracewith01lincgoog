'xxvi mn OF Itonion

But the close resemblance of some passages tc existing hag·
ments oi Greek poetry is no sufficient ground for the opinion
often expressed, that the Roman lyrist was a merc copyist ol
Greek originalis, and it was a singularly gratuitons observa
tion oi an early critic,¹ “that if the Lyrics ol the Greeks were
'extant very many of his thefts 'might be detected.’' On the
contrary, those pleces and parts ol pieces which, hy the prc-
sence cf the originale, wc know were horrowed from Greek
writers, so far from diminishing the separation of the Roman
poet, are such as none, bnt a master could prodncc; his trans-
lations of single words and phrases are execntcd with such a
rare felicity, that the language “ seems to ho born, as it were,
with the thought,²¹ and those passages, which are reprodnc
tione from the Greek, cre written with snch aboldness and
genial freedom, that they admirably illustrate that power of
adaptation, which fixos the stampoi originality upon an ao-
knowledged imitation.⁸ And we may nse for Horace, as War-
ton hes donc for Pope,⁸ the words with which Virgii is said
to have replied to those who aceused him of horrowing from
Homer: “ Cur noo a'llc' qrmqroe cadent furto maroc?
Verum intellectum, facilius esse Herculi chacucc, pacem
Hocrcrc versum surrepcrc.’²⁴

But very many of the best odes oi Horace are so thorough·
iy Roman in their whole character, in their occasion, subjecta,
sentimenta, imagery, and allusions, that they could hy no pos-
sibility have been formed upon Greek models, but are peca-
liorly and exclusively his own. This class includes those
which celebrato the glories cl Augustus in peace and in war,
and the two which describe the victories of his step-sons

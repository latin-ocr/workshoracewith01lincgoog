Plato once taught his disciples,be listened to the tenchings
ot‘ Theornnestus, who was then the chief of that celebrated

school of philosophy, probably, too, with something ottho ἵ

roving turn of mind, to which be often playfully alludes, he
frequently strayed from the Academy te the lecture-roem ol
Philodemus ¹ the Epicurean, and of Cratippus tbe Peripatetic,
who at this time numbered among bis pupils the son of (licere 3'

arrd thus with the independent and practical spirit which ¹

always characteriaed him in luter life, he heard all the great
teaehers of philosophy, and began to construet for himself, not
a consistent speculative system, buta body of sound and
valuable lessons, that might be taught and praetised in the

real life of the world. But we moy well suppose that, guided ,

by his prevailing tastes, he was constantly occupied at Atheus
with Attio literature, and especially with the immortul produc-
tions of the Attio Musa. Doubtless he studied Homer again,
perhaps in the identical copy he had thumbed orer at school, and
he now read the great poet with a sense of freedom aud a lively
intelligent interest he had never felt under the rule of Orbilius,
and to his more willing mind and more mature intelleet
the tale of Achilles² wratb,⁸ and of the wanderings of Ulysses,
now began to reveal, as they had never done before, all their
wondrous significance. The masterpieccs of the Grecisn
drama must also bave found their place in this more genisl
course of study3 especially the plays of Aristophanes⁴ and ol

Ι other writers of the Old Comedy, which undoubtedly bad s

large share of influenee in developing that singular aptitnde
for the nice observation and skilful pointing of lite and man·
nera, which he afterwards displayed in a kindred speeies ol
poetry in his own language. With the lyric writers, too, be
gained a familiar acquaintance, and in tbe stndy of these great
medela trained himself for the honors he was destined to win

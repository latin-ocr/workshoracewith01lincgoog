derings, after much thought aud discipline, something ot'a sense oi
quiet and inward treedom, ἴοι· which we are longing, and which he cea
help us attain. We may gether up from his words the materiale for
a philosophy of life, which is better as a practical guida than the specu·
lative systema οἰ the poet’s time; more noble and elevatingthan tha
Epicurean, mora humane aad humanizing than the Stoic; perhaps, iu·
dead, the uuest and tha best, that the uuaided wisdom oi man cau

The poetical Epistle is a form of composition which Horace invented,
md iu which, though oilen imitated, he has never been equalled. Most
of his imitatore, while they have net sailed to perceive and to admira .
that rare union of the stile aud the dalea* the instructira and the eu·
tertaining, in which lies the secret ot‘ Horace’s power, have yet pressed
too far either the one or the other οἰ these qualities,and so have
verged either to the dryand didactic‚ or to the low and trivia l; anderen
Pope and Boilcan, have, with all their merit, fallen below the genial
excellence ot' their original. ln that wonderful mingling oi' thoughttul
eamestuess and playt'ul humor, which, ever near together, and always
lust in place, dignisy and enliveu one another, now pointing a sober pre-

’ cept with a sprightly jest, now drawing greve lessam stom a gay suble,

and¹ like tha well attempered lights and shades ot‘ a tine picture, blond·
ing “severe truth '¹ and ¹‘ faery fiction ¹⁸ into au harmonicus whole,-

, l‘u that singular anion ot poet and philosopher, the man of wit and

genius with theman of sound sense and judgment, that we see every
where in the Epistles of Horace, he appears at once the inventor and
the unrivalled master os this species ol composition.

Finally, it is worthy ot' remark, in this brief estimate ol these writ-
ings, that, while they are the most orlginal aud the most perfect oi the
works of Horace, they are also the most characteristic os all the pro-
ductione oi the Roman Muse. They ara the genuine poetry os the Ro-
man lise3 they embody in a most finished poetic form, those qualities ot
the national character, that for long centurias were at enee the glory
and the salety os Rome. That strong practical sense, that earnestness

· and loveot' order, those virtues ol temporanea, frugality‚ moderatiori,

seli-government, which mark and set apert the Roman from all other
types ot· ancient character,-all these have found, iu the Epistles oi
Horace, ajust aud poetic expression. There while we see as in a
mirror, tha image ot· a Roman poet-il net the most gitted οἰ the poeta
of Rome, certainly the poet of largest experisnce, both in lise and in
art, and oi incomparably the greatest influance,-we also behold tha
noblest end truest collection oi the Romen spirit and character.

. Nouos ΟΝ THE EPISTLES.

m

Tun Epistlos ol Horace, the latest ol his works, are the maturost
stulta ol his literary studies and culture, and ol his observation and
experienoc of human lit'o. ln tho form ot* lhmiliar communications to
personal friends, they disolose ιο ua the interior οι· the poet’s mind and
lteart, and the lise ol thought and feeling, that dowed euthero in even
canent, in the last and best years ol his life. Itis thia subjective oha-

and yet in dnishcd verse, his own habitual thoughts and sentimenta,
whether on art, poetry, philosophy or letters, his most cherished
wishes and testes, his exporicnoes of the world, and what they haro
taught him, and all the way in which ho is wont to view, to under·
stand, and to eujoy human life.

Ιι is also preciscly this subjective feature ol these writings, which
gives them their interest and their value, which has drawn and fastened
to them so many minds and hearts, and ever instrueted and delighted
them. They teaoh us, thom out tho poet's own experience, so many
leosons os good sense, moderatiori and wisdom, fitted to the conduct os
our own every-day lives; which charm na by their serene humor and
grnoedrl diction, and win us by their humane and friendly tone. Wa

happy spirit, that has practically learned what wa too need to know;

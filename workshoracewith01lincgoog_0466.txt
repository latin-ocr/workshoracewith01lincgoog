lu distinction from the Pbrygian (see note, Ο. 111, 19, 18), the Lydian
pipe was adopted to a quiclr and lively style ot' music. The plural rs
used, titiis, because the ancients played upon two pipes at the same
time. They were called tibine pares (optol), when they were both base,
or both treble; and tibiae imperes, when one wns base and the other
treble. Each pipe wasa seperate instrument, having its own mouth
pisos, though both were plnyed by the sarno musician. Tbere was also
a distinction of tilio dentre and tibio sittim ‚- the former was held in
the right hand, and produced the base notes, hence called by Herodotus
the “ male” or “ manly” pipc; the latter was held in the leli hand, and
produced the treble notes, hence called the “ female ” or ‘⁸ womanly ’¹
pipe—See Diet. Antiqq, und Ricb’s companion under 'libitu sud tho
illustration on p. 199 oi this volume.

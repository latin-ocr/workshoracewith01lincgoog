cultivated, well-regulated mind, in reasonable desines, in an

¹ even, eontented spirit. It is here that we discover the secret

of Horace’s power over so many minds; it is nothis style,
with its rare union of elegance and vigor, it is not his terso
ness and felicity of expression,-these alone could never ex·
plain nor could they create so wide und enduriug spopulur·
ity3 but it is the wise thoughts, just sentimenta, aud genuine
trutbs, universally applicabis to the every-day lives of men,
which are the stapla ol his work, and of which the greces oi
style, the felicitous expression, are the rich and finished set

j ting,—it is these that have made him the favorite companion,

not only of classical scholare, bnt of statcsmen, philosophers,
and men of the world; the most read, the best remembered,
and the most frequently quoted of all the writers of antiquity.

The fame of Horace hos far exoeeded the measure ol his

ἶ own proud propheoy.¹ It has outlived those solemn proces·

sions to the (lapitol of pontiffs and vestal virgins, it has out·
lived the entire religion of ancient Rome, and ancient Romo
itself, and after the lapse of ages, it still tlourishes iu all its

, curly freshness; and with equal truth and beauty has it been

described in an apostrophe to Horace, by an Italian poet:

selgo ls eima ombrose, e frescoe verde
Veggio l’alloro tuo lassh tenerri,
Che per sl lunga ett foglia non perde:

Veggiol dell’ immortal tua litandorum
n le immagini belle e i sacri versi
Con la grand¹ Ombra tua girarvi intorno.

“I climb the shady summit, and behold
Thy laurei there still ever fresh aud green, Δ
Which thro’ long ages not a leaf heth lost:

1 see-it deeked with thy immortal tyre,
And beauteous images end sacred verse
‘stit wandering round it with thy mighty eholef‘.

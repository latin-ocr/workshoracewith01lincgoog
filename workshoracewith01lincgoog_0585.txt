mun papul03 as iu the tragedy of Medea ascribed to Seneca3 but in
Euripides the action takes place elsewhere, aud is related by the
llyyetos or messenger3 and so in general, in the Greek tragedias, such
soenes are narrated, not acted. The medem drama, on the contrary, is
not always iu a'ccordance with the precept 01 1101100; as, for instance,
Shakspeare¹s plays, in which deaths and murders are so often repre-
cenred—189. innte actu. The rule to have just tire acts was strictly
observed hythe Roman dramatists. The Greek tragedies had three
parts, 1111111111γο, the tetradiae, arrd the ἔξοδος. Where the episodes
were three in number, the play thus had dre parts, correspondiug to
the five Roman 1111111,Ι but there was no dxed number of episodcs.-
Orelli. Without doubt (as Orelli suggests) the Roman actas were
modelled upon those parts 01 the Greek tragedy. Iu modern literature,
the Treuch and the Italian drama each observe Horaee’s rule; so, too,
iu their master-pleces, the English and the German—191· bigne

“ 1 play, 111 iutrigner 11111111, avenger, rescuer, here one who ean develop

or acrovel the iutrigue, bring about the dinmoenaent. A writer, lacking
invention, would be apt, in the catastrophe 01 the play, to have re-
course to the sirpernatural, aud rescue his hero by the interpositiou ol
a god; hence the necessity 01 this rule of Horace. Euripides often
avsiled himself 01 such means iu the demoliunt 01 his plois-Compi.
